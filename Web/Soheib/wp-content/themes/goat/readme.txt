GOAT is a basic responsive sports theme for SportsPress.

== Description ==
GOAT is a basic responsive sports theme in black and white with a 
customizable accent color so that you can match your team colors. 
The theme has a top navigation bar, a social menu, a two column grid layout, 
and room for a front page header image. 
It has a footer widget area with room for all your widgets (including two custom widgets), 
and one extra front page widget area below the header. 
GOAT also has support for full width content, video header and logo. 
The theme is designed for use together with the SportsPress plugin, 
but works well as a blog even without the plugin. 
The theme is also compatible with WooCommerce and Jetpack.

GOAT is a child theme of Embla.
